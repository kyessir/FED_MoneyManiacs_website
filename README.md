## Design Process
 
With the rise of cost of living in Singapore, many are wondering how to survive with the increase of expenses. We have centred our website based on this, and aimed to create a website that teaches financial literacy, such that individuals can learn and grow their capital. We hope that users of this website will be engaged with the website, and learn many lessons which can be brought back to their financial life too!

### User Audience Intent and Purpose

We have decided to focus our website on the youths (scondary school/ tertairy age), the young adults and the elderly for our website. However, this website's information can be used by people of all ages to learn more about expenses. We hope that users will be more well-informed about the financial world and be able to nagvigate through it, to not be a 'maniac' to money!

Example user profiles:
- As a young adult, I want to learn how to budget properly, so that I will be able to control my expenses and grow my savings when I start working.
- As a secondary school student, I want to complete the budgeting game, so that I will be able to share my progress and show off to my friends while learning vaulable information for my future. I would also like to track my expenses in a fun and interactive way.
- As a young adult, I want to learn more about myself as an investor, so that I will be able to make wise decisions, such that I will be able to invest my money accordingly, depending on my situation and current savings.
