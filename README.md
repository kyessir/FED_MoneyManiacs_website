## Design Process
 
With the rise of cost of living in Singapore, many are wondering how to survive with the increase of expenses. @jigglewiggle101 and I have centred our website based on this, and aimed to create a website that teaches financial literacy, such that individuals can learn and grow their capital. We hope that users of this website will be engaged with the website, and learn many lessons which can be brought back to their financial life too!

Example user profiles:
- As a youth, I want to learn how to budget properly, so that I will be able to control my expenses and grow my savings.
- As a primary/lower secondary school student, I want to complete the budgeting game, so that I will be able to share my progress and show off to my friends while learning vaulable information for my future.
- As a young adult, I want to learn more about myself as an investor, so that I will be able to make wise decisions, such that I will be able to invest my money accordingly, depending on my situation and current savings.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
